## Template Types

Issue templates typically include:

- **Bug Report Templates**: Structured forms for reporting bugs with steps to reproduce
- **Feature Request Templates**: Forms for proposing new features
- **Chore Templates**: For routine tasks or maintenance
- **Community Templates**: For community, collaboration, or governance issues
- **Documentation Templates**: For documentation or help content issues
- **Developer Experience (DX) Templates**: For issues affecting developer workflows
- **Refactor Templates**: For code refactoring suggestions
- **Support Templates**: For questions or support requests
- **Technical Debt Templates**: For tracking technical debt
- **Test Templates**: For testing or quality assurance issues

## Output Location

By default, issue templates are saved to the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory in your repository root. This follows GitHub's standard convention for issue templates.

## Adding Labels to Your Repository

To ensure your repository uses the same labels as GitForge, follow these steps:

### 1. Copy Labels from GitForge
You can export labels from GitForge using the `gh label clone` command (requires the GitHub CLI):

```bash
gh label clone RafaelJohn9/gitforge --repo <your-username>/<your-repo>

```

This will duplicate all labels (like bug, feature, chore, documentation, etc.) into your repository.

### 2. Verify Labels

After cloning, check your repo’s Issues > Labels section on GitHub to confirm they match GitForge’s label set.

### 3. Maintain Consistency

Whenever GitForge updates its label set, rerun the clone command to sync updates.
